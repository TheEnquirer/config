# How can you say no? 
*And yes, this is OSX*



## This is 

my config for quite a few things. Notably,

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), the ***BEST*** text editor
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), a super fast terminal emulator 
- [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai), a window manager (look at those cool gaps!) 
- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), my main keybind manager
- [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org), my alternate keybind manager 
- [Surfing Keys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys): vim keybinds **everywhere.** 
- [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), I have some cool aliases check em out 



## Philosophy 

Minimize time between thought and completion of action. 
Make it entirely keybind navigble -- mouse is sin. 

Keybinds should be intentional, and build upon eachother. 

(and, of course, dark mode best mode)

With that said, here's a preview of my 

## Keybinds!

H. J. K. L. 

Vim keybinds in my browsers, vim keybinds for my windows, and vim keybinds in my, well, vim. 
(with caps-lock rebound to control)

- skhd + yabai
    - Focusing is done with `` ctrl + cmd - h/j/k/l `` and `` ctrl + cmd - `first letter` `` for opening specific applications, my main way of navigation 
    - Swapping is done with `` ctrl + alt - h/j/j/l `` and `` ctrl + shift + alt - h/j/j/l `` for warp swap 
    - And a bunch more you can check out [here](https://github.com/TheEnquirer/config/blob/master/skhd/skhdrc)
- tmux 
    - Is normally mixed with yabai, and works with ``ctrl + h/j/k/l`` for individual splits
- terminal 
    - I came from iterm and require a toggleable terminal focus, so I added hammerspoon with the ``ctrl - ctrl`` keybind for toggling focus to and back from my programming enviroment 

This is the basis for most of my keybinds. 

## Apps 

I use include:

- [Condution](www.condution.com), an amazing task manager. Check it out. 
- My web browsers are 
    - [Opera](https://www.opera.com) and [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), my terminal emulator 
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), better spotlight search
- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com), for mail 
- and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), for note taking

And huge thanks to @exr0n and @jemoka for helping me develop my config over the early months of my config and journey into vim 


*More coming 'soon(?)'!*
