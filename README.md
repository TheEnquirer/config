# How can you say no? 
* And yes, this is OSX *

## This is 
---
my config for quite a few things. Notably,

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), the ***BEST*** text editor
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), a super fast terminal emulator 
- [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai), a window manager (look at those cool gaps!) 
- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), my main keybind manager
- [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org), my alternate keybind manager 
- [Surfing Keys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys): vim keybinds **everywhere.** 
- [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), I have some cool aliases check em out 

```
```

## Philosophy 
---

Minimize time between thought and completion of action. 
Make it entirely keybind navigble -- mouse is sin. 

Keybinds should be intentional, and build upon eachother. 


With that said, here's a preview of my 

# Keybinds!

H. J. K. L. 

Vim keybinds in my browsers, vim keybinds for my windows, and vim keybinds in my, well, vim. 
(with caps-lock rebound to control)

- skhd + yabai
    - Focusing is done with `` ctrl + cmd - h/j/k/l ``
